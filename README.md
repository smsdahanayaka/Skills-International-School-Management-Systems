# Skills International School Management System

The integration of CRUD operations in the Add New User and Student Registration sections offers total control over user and student data, promoting efficient data administration. The programme places a high premium on securing user data and sensitive information by utilizing secure authentication mechanisms and user access limits. A well-structured and maintained codebase is ensured by the use of controller-based approaches and MVC architecture, making future upgrades and changes simpler
